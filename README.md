# nextjs-prisma-opinion-rater

In this project I'll try to make a wep site that
has user login signup functionality, and once
the user is loged in they can create and rate
opinions.

This project will also be my first attempt at working
with [Material UI](https://mui.com/).

Form validation was done using [React-Hook-Form](https://www.react-hook-form.com/), [React-Hook-Form-Resolvers](https://github.com/react-hook-form/resolvers) and [yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup)
